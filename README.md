# Todo App

The most generic project in JS history.

## ðŸ§± TypeScript Structure

ðŸ“¦ `ts/`

| File                          | Responsibility |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| `main.ts`                    | App entry point â€“ initializes state and hooks up form and UI rendering |
| `todo.types.ts`              | Interface representing a single todo item |
| `todoList.types.ts`          | Interface defining the structure and behavior of a todo list |
| `todoList.ts`                | Class implementing the `TodoListContract` â€“ handles list state and persistence |
| `displayTodoList.ts`         | Renders all todos into the DOM using a document fragment |
| `createTodoHTML.ts`          | Pure DOM factory that returns a `<li>` element for a todo |
| `todoButtonEventListeners.ts`| Wires up completion toggle logic for todo buttons |
| `todoForm.ts`                | Handles todo form submission and validation |

## ðŸ“± How the Core of the App Works

Everything revolves around a `TodoList` instance, created after the DOM content has loaded.

### ðŸ§  State

The `TodoList` instance manages state via one property and several methods:

```ts
class TodoList implements TodoListContract {
  constructor(public todos: Array<Todo> = []) {}

  addTodo(task: string, priority: number): boolean {
    if (!(task.length > 0)) return false;
    if (!(priority >= 1 && priority <= 3)) return false;
    const todo: Todo = { task, completed: false, priority };
    this.todos.push(todo);
    return true;
  }

  toggleTodoCompleted(todoIndex: number): void {
    const todo = this.todos[todoIndex];
    if (!todo) throw new Error(`Invalid todo index: ${todoIndex}`);
    todo.completed = !todo.completed;
  }

  getTodos(): Array<Todo> {
    return this.todos;
  }

  // ...
}
```

The todos array holds the current list.
The methods allow you to add a new todo, retrieve the list, and toggle a todoâ€™s completion state.

Yes, I renamed the original `markTodoCompleted()` method to `toggleTodoCompleted()`.
Why? Because I wanted the user to be able to revert a completed todo in case they accidentally marked something as done when it wasnâ€™t.

Also, sidenote: `getTodos()` is technically redundant since todos is already public, but I left it in because the assignment required me to define this method.

I couldn't make todos private either, since the interface didn't allow it â€” you can't declare private properties in interfaces.

A potential workaround would be to omit todos from the interface and declare it as private in the class, then expose it only via `getTodos()`. But that wouldâ€™ve gone against the assignmentâ€™s requirement to define todos in the interface.

So yeah my hands were tied, but at least I learned something from it, so thatâ€™s cool.

### ðŸ’¾ Persistence

In addition to managing in-memory state, the TodoList instance handles persistence through localStorage, keeping your todos between browser sessions:

```ts
class TodoList implements TodoListContract {
  private static readonly key = "todos";

  saveToLocalStorage(): void {
    const json = JSON.stringify(this.todos);
    localStorage.setItem(TodoList.key, json);
  }

  loadFromLocalStorage(): void {
    const json = localStorage.getItem(TodoList.key);
    this.todos = !json ? [] : (JSON.parse(json) as Array<Todo>);
  }
}
```

It uses a private static readonly key. Here's why:

    private â†’ to encapsulate it within the class

    static â†’ so it's shared across all instances

    readonly â†’ so it can't be reassigned after declaration

One small but intentional design decision: in functions like `displayTodoList`, I type the parameter using the interface `TodoListContract` instead of the concrete `TodoList` class.

I did this because if I ever create another class that implements the same interface, I can reuse the same functions without changing their type signatures or duplicating logic across multiple class-specific functions.

There's more to the app, of course, such as event listeners, DOM rendering, form logic, etc.
But I believe the real goal of the assignment was to demonstrate a solid grasp of object-oriented programming in TypeScript, which Iâ€™ve aimed to show here.
